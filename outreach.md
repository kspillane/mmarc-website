        Amateur radio is about service. MMARC is dedicated to serving Jefferson City and Cole County through emergency communications and public events.
    </p>

    <h2>Emergency Communications</h2>
    <p>
        During severe weather and civil emergencies, MMARC members activate to provide reliable communication links when other systems fail. We work closely with the Cole County Emergency Management Agency and the National Weather Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Public Service Events</h2>
    <p>
        We provide communications support for local events such as marathons, bike rides, and parades. This not only helps the community but serves as valuable training for emergency operations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        Interested in learning about electronics and radio physics? We hold regular educational sessions and license testing.
