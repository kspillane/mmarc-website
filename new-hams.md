        Welcome to the world of Amateur Radio! Whether you're interested in emergency preparedness, technical experimentation, or just talking to people around the world, there's a place for you here.

    <h2>Getting Licensed</h2>
    <p>
        The entry-level license is the <strong>Technician Class</strong>. It gives you access to all VHF/UHF frequencies and some HF privileges. The test is 35 multiple-choice questions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>GMRS</h2>
    <p>
        General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a great stepping stone. It requires a license (no test, just a fee) and allows for higher power and repeater use compared to FRS walkie-talkies.
    </p>

    <h2>Meshtastic</h2>
    <p>
        Meshtastic is an open-source, off-grid, decentralized mesh network built to run on affordable, low-power devices. MMARC is actively building a local mesh network in Jefferson City.
